    "In the previous lab we saw how you can use the WWW as a source of data, even when the information presented is not there for the purpose of data analysis (i.e., it is there for you as a browser to read it).\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes, though, you are lucky and the data source you're after will have an **API** set up so that you don't need to scrape it. An **API** is a detailed and rigorous set of rules that you must use in order to get something from a server.\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, many APIs in the web gives you back if you write the _right_ url.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider searching \"something\" on http://www.duckduckgo.com. If you take a look at the result page, you will see that the url is something like:  \n",
    "https://duckduckgo.com/?q=something&t=h_&ia=about\n",
    "\n",
    "The part before the `?` is the _base url_, the human readable name of the _server_ that is giving you the data. what is after the `?` defines the various argument of the duckduckgo API. `q` probably stands for \"query\", and after the `=` is where you put the terms you are looking for; `&` separates various arguments; `t` and `ia` define other aspects of the behaviour of the search engine.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can pass more arguments, and change the behaviour of the server. For example, in duckduckgo we can appen a `format=xml` to get the data in an xml format (instead of the html format with all the fancy visualization stuff). We may do it because the xml format **is** intended for programmatic data extraction and we are trying to get that data. Try to browse to:\n",

    "https://duckduckgo.com/?q=something&t=h_&ia=about&format=xml\n",

    "Dealing with strings is not ideal: you need to tweak theme everytime you want to perform a different query, and that opens the door to errors. Also, our credo is that everytime we have to repeat some task, it's better to write a function for it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, write wrapper functions to perform the queries you wrote in the previous exercise. Try and write both very specific, _atomic_, functions that do just one very specific thing, and some more general function that can do more than one thing combining the more atomic functions together.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if you are using the numbersapi, write both something like `get_integer_math()` that only allows you to query `[integer]/math` (e.g., Ramanujan's taxi plate [1729](http://numbersapi.com/1729/math)); and something like `get_number_type()` which allows for different types specifications (trivia, math, date, or year).\n",
    "\n",

Take a look at [leaflet](https://rstudio.github.io/leaflet/json.html) for an idea on how to use what you get back from GDELT. Also, Alex Bresler has started working on an [R wrapper](https://github.com/abresler/gdeltr2) that may get you inspired.\n",

Roughly speaking, it is a list of lists of lists of ... `purrr` is very handy when you want to extract information from a JSON file. But do see also the `jsonlite` package, [intro here](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/jsonlite/vignettes/json-aaquickstart.html).
