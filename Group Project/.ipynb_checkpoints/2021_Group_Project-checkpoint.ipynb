    "As a team, you need to identify _good_ set of data sources. A _good_ datasource for this projects is a source of data that:  \n",
    "1. you can read and handle, or learn to read and handle in a very short time. Formats that are too exotique may be very interesting, but they may also require a too long time to import into anything familiar to you. To be fair, most of the datasets you can find in the sources we suggest you are in a good format. _pro tip_: avoid data presented in pdf tables, unless you are ready to do a lot of hand work (if you do, it's great).\n",
    "2. it is not already in the most suitable data model. If the source dataset is already perfect, there's little you can do and you won't have the opportunity to exhibit your skills. Government or NGO data is usually quite dirty, so they represent good choices.\n",
    "3. it is _interesting_ for you. I don't have a strong interest in cars, and for me working a month on car data set would be a boring hell. But maybe you LOVE cars, than that dataset would be perfect for you. Try to consider your passions, or look at the news to see what may be a hot topic. Avoid abused datasets (i.e., _iris_ or _mtcars_ or _titanic_ or ...): we have already seen all possible projects about that stuff.\n",
    "4. it is _joined_ or _joinable_ to other data sources. Consider the presence of common identifiers (things as: region names, product ids, years or dates, ...) that you may use to connect two or more data sources and tell a story (great data stories often emerge from connections)."
